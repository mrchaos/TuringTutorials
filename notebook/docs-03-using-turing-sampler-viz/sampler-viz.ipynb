The block below loads the relevant libraries and defines a function for plotting the sampler's trajectory across the posterior.\n\nThe Turing model definition used here is not especially practical, but it is designed in such a way as to produce visually interesting posterior surfaces to show how different samplers move along the distribution."

It can often be tricky to set the correct parameters for this sampler however, and the `NUTS` sampler is often easier to run if you don't want to spend too much time fiddling with step size and and the number of steps to take. Note however that `HMC` does not explore the positive values μ very well, likely due to the leapfrog and step size parameter settings."
